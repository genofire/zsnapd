 .
   * Configuration is stored in configuration files with the ini file 
     format.
   * Uses Python3
   * Native systemd support.
   * Triggers the configured actions based on time or a '.trigger' file 
     present in the dataset's mountpoint.
   * Can take snapshots (with a yyyymmdd timestamp format).
   * Can replicate snapshots to/from other nodes.
   * Push based when the replication source has access to the replication
     target.
   * Pull based when the replication source has no access to the replication
     target. Typically when you don't want to give all nodes access to the
     backup/replication target.
   * Cleans all snapshots with the yyyymmdd timestamp format based on a GFS 
     schema (Grandfather, Father, Son).
   * Supports pre and post commands.
